## Ignore SR and allow everyone to roll
If the item is SRed, the addon will only watch rolls for players who SRed. However, if you want everyone to roll, even if the item is SRed, use /arf instead of /rf. "arf" stands for "All Roll For".

## Create a Soft Res list at https://raidres.fly.dev (1.12.1) or https://softres.it (2.5.2).
Ask raiders to add their items.
When ready, lock the raid and click on RollFor export (raidres.fly.dev) or Gargul Export (softes.it) button.
Click on Copy RollFor data to clipboard buton.
Click on the minimap icon or type /sr.
Paste the data into the window.
Click Import!.
The addon will tell you the status of SR import.
Hovering over the minimap icon will tell you who did not soft-res.
